## Goals

There are several goals of this project:

1. to make the project from an idea to a full value comfy GUI app through several steps: 
- making the UI concept

- making an app architecture
- choosing technologies and frameworks
- breaking to tasks and milestones
- writing a code
2. to train design skills: programming design patterns like Dependency Injection, Command
3. to make a **QT** based customized GUI app

4. to study how to build an Android app
5. to touch OpenGL ES shaders
6. to have a fun playing with bitmaps pixels while making simple filters from my university Machine Graphics classes
7. to play with Jankins
8. to explore testing and logging libraries
               
            
***

             
## Upcoming features:
1. covering with tests
2. logging
3. translations
4. QML
5. UI animations
6. uploading images to the cloud
7. integration with social networks to uploading and downloading photos from/to there
8. add image editing tools and more complicated filters
